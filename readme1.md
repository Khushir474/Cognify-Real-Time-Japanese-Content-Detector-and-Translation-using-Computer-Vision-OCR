# 🏠 PropPrice Prophet: Real Estate Price Prediction Model

> "Because nobody likes seeing a 1BHK priced higher than a penthouse next door!"

## 🎯 What's This All About?
Company X came to us with a trust problem - their users were seeing wildly different prices for similar properties and starting to raise eyebrows. Our mission? Build a smart price prediction model that makes sure property listings make sense. Think of it as a reality check for real estate!

## 🔍 The Challenge
- Users spotting price inconsistencies (and not the good kind)
- Trust in platform taking a hit
- Need for automated price validation

## 💡 Our Solution
We're building a price discovery and regulation model that:
- Predicts reasonable price ranges for properties
- Considers factors like:
 - Location & Sub-area
 - Property type (from cozy 1BHKs to luxurious penthouses)
 - Area in sq. ft
 - Amenities (pools, gyms, parks - the works!)
 - Township features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (our trusty snake friend)
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- Pandas for data wrangling
- [Other cool tech we used]
